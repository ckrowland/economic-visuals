      Everything in words can be explained visually.

        For simulations there seems to be two ends. A real simulation
        which models everything perfectly, or a fake simulation which is just
        a pretty moving picture for a theory. Both have their place. A real
        simulation can predict the future. A fake one can help teach theory.
        But I think there is something much more interesting in the middle.

    <p class="text-body">
        A great scientific term is hypothesis generating research. 
        Its science but in reverse. You look at uncontrolled data
        first then come up with questions about what you think is related.
        Later when you have a hypothesis you want to test, then you use normal 
        science to control all the variables and run an experiment. The science 
        part of the process gets all the credit as it is where we learn 
        everything. But the first half is just as important. 
        How do we come up with hypotheses?
    </p>
    <p class="text-body">
        This is the yin to science's yang. Science is formal, academic, serious.
        Generating hypotheses is informal, quickly discredited, and playful. 
        It is not serious so it get's overlooked. This is why we need 
        simulations in the middle.
    </p>
    <p class="text-body">
        A completely fake simulation has no direct relation to the real world 
        and we can't come up with hypotheses. A completely real simulation is
        indistinguishable from the real world and doesn't create
        hypotheses because it already accounts for all of them. What we need is 
        half real, half fake. Real enough that it must exist in reality, and be
        bound by things like distance and time, but fake enough that we can 
        make assumptions and see the changes in reality these lead to.
