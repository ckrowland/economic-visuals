    <h1 class="fw-light">Why do this?</h1>
    <p class="lead text-body-secondary">
      Everything in words can be explained visually.
    </p>
    <p class="text-body">
      There is knowing and there is understanding. Knowing is skin deep.
      Understanding is spiritual. Understanding is not concerned with
      information but with a deep emotional knowledge of every moving part.
    </p>
    <p class="text-body">
      You can be able to describle something. Or you can fully understand something.
      You understand all the conditions of a thing. You understand
      how changing the conditions would change the thing. You understand
      why we need all the parts because you tried to take out all the parts
      one by one and saw every way in which it can fail. You put everything
      back together again and saw its life re-emerge. You saw its
      inefficiencies. You see its potential for growth. You are its closest
      friend and mentor.
    </p>
    <p class="text-body">
      I don't want to know things, I want to understand them. And that
      requires many experiments with a thing. Trying in every way to
      break or simplify something until you know it deeply.
    </p>
    <p class="text-body">
      Thats what I am doing with these simulations. I think markets deserve
      to be understood deeply and simply. Markets exist even if you try to
      abolish them. They always reappear because they are just an inherent
      part of life. Wherever there are scarce resources there are markets.
      We must understand them deeply.
